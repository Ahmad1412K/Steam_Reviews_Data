## Potential Applications
potential applications that may use it are:

*  **Recommendation Systems For Steam Games**

*  **Word Cloud Generation Models**

*  **Analyzing Trends Between Users**

## Usage
Simply run the Python notebook and follow the instructions in it, you can make some modifications like:
### Update the SteamIDs.csv file with more games
This can be accomplished in multiple ways, maybe manually downloading a list like I did, or you can take a more sophisticated approach like using the steamgriddb module which gives you access to data about all Steam games, or you can generate a list using the Steam API https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/ 
### Configure how many reviews for each game 
This can be accomplished by changing the num_per_page parameter in the API URL

## Database
The notebook includes the code that adds the data collected to a MongoDB database as is, you just need to configure the database it self and then add the list of reviews to it
